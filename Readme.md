Test assignment - Backend developer 2023-01-16 updated
Need to create a service class that implements App\ShippingServiceInterface interface.
Service should send a command to Amazon's fulfillment network (FBA) to fulfill seller order using
seller inventory in Amazon's fulfillment network (FBA) and return the tracking number as string for
this order when method ship will be invoked.
Link to FBA API documentation: https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api
Please update, how much time did the assignment take.
Thank you, and good luck!
